# Assignment 1
This assignment has 4 parts:
 - Math Calculation
 - Prime Number Detection
 - String Characters
 - Sort Words

## Math Calculation 
#### You can find the source code [Here](./src/assignment/MathCalc.java)
In this part, we calculated the volume of the sun and earth, then the rate of their volumes.
By circle volume formula and having diameters of sun and earth, we calculated their volumes.
Then, by dividing the volume of sun by the volume of earth, the rate has been reached.

## Prime Number Detection
#### You can find the source code [Here](./src/assignment/Primes.java)
In the problem, we should extract prime numbers between 1 to 50. we should change the code by the following rules:
- Uses labeled continue instead of break. (`continue outer`)
- Does not require the isPrime variable.
- When testing whether an integer is prime, it is sufficient to try to divide by integers up to the square root of the number being tested. (`Math.sqrt(i)`)

## String Characters
